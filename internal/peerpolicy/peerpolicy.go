// Package peerpolicy decides whether a remote libp2p peer is permitted to
// federate with this node: connect (via the ConnectionGater), enter the DHT
// routing table, use org-peer discovery, and open relay streams. A single
// Policy instance is the source of truth for all four gates.
//
// This is a leaf package: it imports only the libp2p peer type so that the
// node, registry, and relay packages can all depend on it without import
// cycles. It performs no network I/O.
//
// Gating is by peer ID only. Domain-based node membership (trusting a peer by a
// DNS-anchored domain) was prototyped but deferred — it added more operational
// friction than per-peer-ID allowlists — so the policy decides purely on the
// authenticated peer ID.
