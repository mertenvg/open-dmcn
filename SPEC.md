# The DMCN Protocol (DMCNP) — Core

DMCN (the Decentralized Mesh Communication Network) is a peer-to-peer,
end-to-end-encrypted store-and-forward mail network where **cryptographic identity
replaces SMTP-style trust**; the DMCN Protocol (DMCNP), specified here, is what its
participants speak:
every address is an Ed25519+X25519 keypair whose self-certifying record is served by the
address's own domain fleet and discovered via DNS ("MX for identity" — no global DHT), and
mail is hybrid-encrypted client-side and parked in recipient-designated relays' mailboxes.

This document describes the **core protocol** — what an independent implementation needs to
interoperate: resolve, verify, send, receive. It is a snapshot of the reference
implementation, not a frozen specification; where they disagree, the implementation and the
schemas in `proto/` are authoritative. Operator/product surfaces (fleet administration,
hosting permits, provisioning, entitlements, relay-assisted client conveniences) are
**extensions outside this core** — see §8 for how they attach without touching it.

## The layered stack

```
 user identity        Ed25519 (sign) + X25519 (ECDH), address = local@domain
        │              self-certifying IdentityRecord, served by the domain's fleet
 resolution           DNS `_dmcn.<domain>` (fp anchor + fleet= + seeds) → fetch signed
        │              records from the domain's fleet over libp2p, verify vs the anchor
 message model        PlaintextMessage → SignedMessage → EncryptedEnvelope
        │              per-message AES-256-GCM CEK, X25519-wrapped per recipient,
        │              split header/body, padded to size-class buckets
 routing              operator-signed RelayHints (which relays hold my mailbox)
        │
 relay service        /dmcn/relay/1.0.0 — STORE / FETCH / mailbox / onion / resolve
        │
 trust / federation   Credential PKI (DNS-anchored DAR), /dmcn/join handshake
        │
 transport            libp2p streams (no DHT — discovery is DNS-seeded)
```

## 1. Identity & addressing

- An identity is an **Ed25519 signing key + X25519 key-exchange key**; the address is
  `local@domain`.
- It is a self-signed **`IdentityRecord`** carrying a monotonic owner-signed `revision`. The
  owner self-signature covers the *identity core* (address, keys, created/expires,
  verification tier, onion flag, revision) — **but not `RelayHints`** (routing is
  operator-owned; see §4) and not the embedded operator credentials.
- **Resolution is DNS-seeded, per-domain — there is no global directory.** A resolver reads
  the mailbox domain's `_dmcn.<domain>` DNS TXT record:

  ```
  _dmcn.<domain>  TXT  "dmcn-verification=v1; fp=<40-hex>[; fleet=<domain>][; seed=<multiaddr>]..."
  ```

  `fp=` is the trust anchor — the first 20 bytes of `SHA-256(ed25519_pub ‖ x25519_pub)` of
  the domain's root key, uppercase hex. `fleet=` optionally defers hosting to another
  domain's nodes (discovery only — spoofing it is DoS, never forgery). `seed=` lists
  bootstrap multiaddrs, each ending `/p2p/<peerID>` so the transport handshake
  authenticates the endpoint. The resolver dials a seed, fetches the domain's DAR and the
  `IdentityRecord` (plus removal/blocklist companions), and verifies everything against the
  mailbox `fp=`. Records are self-certifying, so a wrong or hostile fleet is **DoS-only,
  never a forgery vector**; a domain is served only by its own fleet, never a global
  overlay a foreign majority could censor. NXDOMAIN / no `_dmcn` record means the address
  does not exist; transient DNS failure fails closed.
- **Verification tiers:** addresses register at `TierUnverified` (valid but untrusted) and
  are raised to `TierDomainDNS` by a domain attestation. Verification is enforced
  *reader-side*, so unverified addresses still exist and function; trust is an upgrade,
  not a gate at registration.

## 2. Trust: the Credential PKI

Trust is **domain-anchored, not per-message**. Each domain has a **DomainAuthorityRecord
(DAR)**, served by the domain's fleet and anchored by its `_dmcn` DNS record. The root
delegates to **issuers** (carried in the DAR) under a monotone grants calculus — an issuer
cannot delegate more than it holds, scope only narrows, and grant-bearing credentials
require the `grant` capability to be issued.

A **`Credential`** binds a subject key to a domain along two independent axes: **roles**
(what the credential *is*) and **grants** (actions it *may perform*).

Core roles: `authority` / `sub-authority` (domain authority keys), `node` (a relay's
libp2p peer key — federating), `bridge` (an SMTP bridge peer key), `client` (a pure-client
peer key), `address` (the domain's attestation of an address↔key binding), `routing` (the
operator-owned `RelayHints` for an address). Core grants: `routing`, `address`, `grant`
(delegate). Further roles/grants exist as operator extensions (§8).

**Issuance is authorized by grants, not by a role**: any DAR-enrolled credential whose
grants cover a leaf's roles may issue it; an issued credential is not valid until signed.
Credentials verify by **chaining to the DNS-anchored root** (max depth 8), with a
root-signed **`CredentialBlockList`** companion record for timestamped / key-compromise
revocation. The `address` and `routing` credentials are embedded *inside* the
`IdentityRecord` and excluded from the owner self-signature — so the operator can
(re)issue them (e.g. to re-point routing) without the mailbox owner's key.

**Signing convention (every signature in the protocol):**

```
sig = Ed25519(priv, ctx ‖ deterministic_protobuf(message_without_signature))
```

The canonical form is deterministic protobuf serialization (stable map ordering) of the
message with its signature field cleared; `ctx` is a per-type NUL-terminated
domain-separation tag (e.g. `dmcn-identity-self-v1\0`, `dmcn-dar-self-v1\0`,
`dmcn-credential-v1\0`). One deliberate exception: the whole-message `SignedMessage`
signature is computed over the canonical plaintext with no context tag.

## 3. The message model (client-side, three layers)

`PlaintextMessage` → `SignedMessage` (Ed25519 sender signature) → **`EncryptedEnvelope`**:

- one per-message **AES-256-GCM content key (CEK)**, wrapped per recipient device:

  ```
  cek = random 32 bytes
  for each recipient device:
      eph         = fresh X25519 keypair
      shared      = X25519(eph_priv, recipient_pub)
      kwk         = HKDF-SHA256(shared, info="dmcn-cek-wrap-v1")
      wrapped_cek = AES-256-GCM(kwk, cek)          # nonce 12, tag 16
  ```

- sealed blobs are **padded to size-class buckets** (1 KB / 4 KB / 16 KB / 64 KB / 256 KB /
  1 MB, then round-up-to-MB; layout `[4-byte BE length][payload][zero padding]`) for
  traffic-analysis resistance;
- envelope v2 is **split** into a small listable encrypted header (sender, subject,
  snippet, recipient lists, body commitments) and a large body, so listing an inbox never
  reads bodies; the bcc list appears only on the sender's own copy;
- the body ciphertext blob (`body_nonce‖encrypted_body‖body_tag`) is **content-addressed**
  (`CIDv1(raw, sha2-256)` = `0x01 0x55 0x12 0x20 ‖ SHA-256(blob)`): carried in the clear
  on the envelope for keyless relay verification and committed inside the **signed**
  header. Distinct from the whole-envelope SHA-256 used for retry idempotency.
- `ratchet_pub_key` is reserved for a double-ratchet forward-secrecy upgrade and is zero
  in v1.

All cryptography is **client-side**; relays only ever handle sealed envelopes.

## 4. Routing

- A recipient's mailbox lives on the relays named in its **`RelayHints`** (an ordered
  list: primary + fallbacks).
- **`RelayHints` is operator-owned**: carried in the `routing` credential (signed by a
  `routing`-granted issuer), not the owner self-signature — so an operator can re-point it
  without the mailbox owner's key.
- **Send** = look up the recipient's record → STORE to the first reachable hint
  (failover), or to **all** reachable hints when the recipient's domain DAR sets
  `PolicyReplicateMailbox`. **Receive** = FETCH from *all* your hints and dedup.
- **Portability** = republish with new hints; the address never changes.
- *How* an operator chooses and maintains hints (placement, reservation, rebalance,
  drain) is operator behavior outside the core; the core defines only the hints' format,
  ownership, and how senders/receivers use them.

## 5. Wire protocols (libp2p)

| protocol | framing | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/dmcn/relay/1.0.0` | 4-byte big-endian length prefix + protobuf (4 MB frame cap; bodies chunked past it) | `Store` / chunked `StoreInit`, `FetchInit` → `FetchChallenge` → signed-nonce proof, mailbox ops (`List`/`Body`/`Delete`), the resolve ops (`GetIdentity`/`GetDAR`/`GetFleetRoster`/`GetRemoval`/`GetBlocklist`/`GetRelayDescriptor`) + `PutRecord` (record publication/replication, re-verified on ingest), `Ack`, `Ping`, `OnionForward` |
| `/dmcn/peers/1.0.0` | length-prefixed JSON | cluster peer discovery |
| `/dmcn/join/1.0.0` | varint-delimited protobuf | mutual credential handshake — each side presents its `Credential` + DAR; verified peers enter the set that gates federation |

Every core operation authorizes in one of three ways — none of which is a password:
**message-authenticated** ops carry their proof in the message (a store is valid because
the sender signed the envelope; a fetch is valid because the client answers the relay's
32-byte nonce challenge with a signature from the account key);
**connection-gated** ops (`Ack`, `OnionForward`) require a credential-admitted federated
peer; **public reads** return signed records the reader verifies independently — the one
public write, `PutRecord`, self-gates by re-verifying every record on ingest (self-sig,
DNS anchoring for a DAR, monotonic-revision anti-rollback), so an unverifiable record
simply cannot be stored.

**Federation is deny-by-default and credential-gated**: connections stay open so
`/dmcn/join` can run, and the participation gates check the join credential set.

Vacated arm numbers in `RelayRequest`/`RelayResponse`/`MailboxOp` are `reserved` with
gravestone comments — they belonged to operator extensions (§8) and must never be reused.

## 6. Onion routing (optional capability)

Relays may serve a self-anchored **`RelayDescriptor`** (their X25519 onion key + `node`
credential, signed by their libp2p key — recoverable from the peer ID, so it verifies
without trusting the server), fetched via `GetRelayDescriptor`. A sender builds a
multi-hop onion route (default 3 hops; hops in distinct /24 networks and distinct
domains; optional stable guard entry), ending at the recipient's home relay. Each layer
is an `OnionPacket` sealed to one hop's key; only the innermost delivery layer is padded
to its own bucket classes. A mailbox (`require_onion`) or domain (`PolicyRequireOnion`)
can require onion delivery, in which case relays reject direct STOREs with
`ONION_REQUIRED`.

## 7. SMTP bridge (optional capability)

An implementation may operate an SMTP↔DMCN bridge (`bridge_capability` on its identity
record). Inbound legacy mail is authenticated (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) at the bridge, and the
verdict travels as a signed **`BridgeClassificationRecord`** attachment
(`application/x-dmcn-bridge-classification`) inside the sealed envelope — verified by the
recipient's client against the bridge's published identity, never by trusting the relay.
Outbound delivery returns a signed **`BridgeDeliveryReceipt`**. These are message
payloads, not wire ops: the bridge speaks the same core relay protocol as everyone else.
Honest edge: mail crossing a bridge is TLS-in-transit on the legacy side, not
end-to-end encrypted.

## 8. Extension points (how everything else attaches)

The core deliberately defines the *attachment surfaces* for extensions rather than the
extensions themselves:

- **`IdentityRecord.operator_credentials` (field 28)** — operator-attached credentials
  beyond routing, semantics identified by each credential's roles/attributes; excluded
  from the owner self-signature like `address_credential`/`routing_credential`. The
  same-revision anti-rollback tiebreak is the newest `issued_at` across
  `routing_credential` and these.
- **`Credential.attributes` under `ext.`-prefixed keys** — signature-covered extension
  payloads (base64-encoded marshaled extension messages) without core schema coupling.
- **Separate libp2p protocol IDs** — extension surfaces run their own protocols beside
  the core (`/dmcn/relay` never carries them). Reserved core numbers mark where earlier
  drafts carried them.
- **DAR `policy_flags`** — core defines bits 0 (`REQUIRE_COUNTERSIGN`), 2
  (`REQUIRE_ONION`) and 3 (`REPLICATE_MAILBOX`); other bits are reserved for extensions.

An implementation that ignores every extension interoperates fully: extensions may add
operator capability, never interop requirements.
